### AgriForex
## Overview
This project is a smart contract system built on the Internet Computer (IC) platform to manage crop contracts between farmers and buyers. The system allows farmers to create contracts for their crops, buyers to review and accept these contracts and provides a transparent and secure way to track the status of these agreements.

## Components
1. Farmer Struct
Represents a farmer with essential details such as name, contact information, land size, and more.
Stored in a stable structure for efficient retrieval and management.
2. Buyer Struct
Represents a buyer who purchases crops from farmers.
Contains details like name, contact information, and organization (optional).
Also stored in a stable structure for data consistency.
3. CropContract Struct
Represents a contract between a farmer and a buyer for a specific crop.
Includes details such as land size, expected yield, price per unit, and contract status.
Utilizes an enum type (ContractStatus) to track the status of the contract (e.g., Active, Pending, Inactive).
Usage
1. Adding a Farmer
Farmers can be added to the system by calling the add_farmer function and providing relevant information about the farmer in the FarmerPayload struct.
2. Adding a Buyer
Buyers can be added using the add_buyer function. Similar to adding farmers, buyers provide their details in the BuyerPayload struct.
3. Creating a Crop Contract
Farmers initiate crop contracts through the add_crop_contract function, specifying details in the CropContractPayload struct.
Contracts start with a status of "Pending" and require buyer acceptance.
4. Accepting a Crop Contract
Buyers can accept pending contracts using the accept_contract function by providing the contract ID.
This updates the contract status to "Active" and records the buyer's information.
5. Querying Information
Various query functions (get_farmer, get_buyer, get_crop_contract, etc.) allow users to retrieve information based on IDs, principals, or other criteria.
Data Storage
Data, including farmers, buyers, and crop contracts, is stored in stable structures using the provided StableBTreeMap and memory management system.
The system uses thread-local storage to manage memory and IDs for different types of data.

## Running the project locally

If you want to test your project locally, you can use the following commands:

```bash
# Starts the replica, running in the background
dfx start --background

# Deploys your canisters to the replica and generates your candid interface
dfx deploy
```

Once the job completes, your application will be available at `http://localhost:4943?canisterId={asset_canister_id}`.

If you have made changes to your backend canister, you can generate a new candid interface with

```bash
npm run generate
```

at any time. This is recommended before starting the frontend development server, and will be run automatically any time you run `dfx deploy`.

If you are making frontend changes, you can start a development server with

```bash
npm start
```

Which will start a server at `http://localhost:8080`, proxying API requests to the replica at port 4943.

### Note on frontend environment variables

If you are hosting frontend code somewhere without using DFX, you may need to make one of the following adjustments to ensure your project does not fetch the root key in production:

- set`DFX_NETWORK` to `ic` if you are using Webpack
- use your own preferred method to replace `process.env.DFX_NETWORK` in the autogenerated declarations
  - Setting `canisters -> {asset_canister_id} -> declarations -> env_override to a string` in `dfx.json` will replace `process.env.DFX_NETWORK` with the string in the autogenerated declarations
- Write your own `createActor` constructor
